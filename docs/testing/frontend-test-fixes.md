# Frontend Test Fixes for Client-Side Rendering

This document outlines the changes made to fix the frontend tests for the client-side markdown rendering implementation in Fishki.

## Issues Fixed

1. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - Added `esModuleInterop: true` to tsconfig.json to allow proper importing of React
   - Set `jsx: "react-jsx"` to enable JSX syntax in test files
   - Added proper module resolution settings

2. **Jest Configuration**
   - Updated Jest configuration to properly handle ESM modules
   - Added transformIgnorePatterns to handle the React Markdown library and its dependencies
   - Set up proper module mapping for CSS files

3. **React Markdown Mocking**
   - Created proper mocks for React Markdown and its plugins
   - Used a simple div with data-testid for easier testing

4. **API Client Mocking**
   - Fixed the API client mock to properly handle save operations
   - Used jest.mocked() for proper TypeScript typing of mocked functions

5. **Test Structure**
   - Updated test cases to verify client-side rendering behavior
   - Added tests for real-time preview updates
   - Added tests for error handling

## Key Files Modified

1. **tsconfig.json**
   - Added ESM interop and JSX support

2. **jest.config.js**
   - Updated configuration for proper module handling

3. **setupTests.ts**
   - Added mocks for React Markdown and plugins

4. **MarkdownEditor.test.tsx**
   - Rewrote tests to verify client-side rendering functionality

## Test Cases

The following test cases were implemented to verify the client-side rendering functionality:

1. **Initial Rendering**
   - Verifies that the editor loads with the initial content
   - Checks that the preview shows the rendered markdown

2. **Save and Cancel Functionality**
   - Verifies that the save button triggers the API call
   - Checks that the cancel button calls the appropriate handler

3. **Real-time Preview Updates**
   - Verifies that the preview updates as the user types
   - Ensures no API calls are made for rendering

4. **Error Handling**
   - Tests error handling when saving fails
   - Verifies error messages are displayed to the user

5. **Unsaved Changes Detection**
   - Verifies that the unsaved changes indicator appears when content is modified

## Running the Tests

To run the tests for the MarkdownEditor component:

```bash
cd frontend
npm test -- src/components/__tests__/MarkdownEditor.test.tsx
```

To run all frontend tests:

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Performance Testing**
   - Add tests to measure rendering performance with large documents

2. **Snapshot Testing**
   - Add snapshot tests for consistent rendering

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Add tests that verify the integration between the editor and viewer components

4. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Add tests to verify accessibility features of the editor
